Project ToDo App

Here's a step-by-step procedure for developing an application to manage todos, including creating a project, managing todos, and exporting the project summary to GitHub as a secret gist.

Overview
1 Create a New Project
2 Manage Todos within a Project
3 Export the Project Summary as a Gist on GitHub

Tools and Technologies
1 Backend: Node.js with Express
2 Database: In-memory (or any database like MongoDB if you need persistence)
3 GitHub API: For creating gists

Summary
1 Create a Project: Create, list, and view projects.
2 Manage Todos: Add, edit, update, and delete todos within a project.
3 Export Summary: Generate markdown content and create a secret gist on GitHub.

After the project schema representation the basic auth for user login are:

1 Implement Basic Authentication using an HTTP authentication scheme.
2 For example, using Express.js and basic-auth middleware in Node.js

Home Page Provisions
1 Create a New Project:
*Provide a form to enter project details.
*POST request to create a new project.

2 List All Projects
GET request to retrieve all projects and display them.

3 View a Project
GET request to retrieve and display a specific projectâ€™s details.

Detailed Project View
1 Editable Project Title

*Provide an input field to edit the project title.
*PATCH request to update the title.

2 List of Todos
Display todos with description, date, and status.

3 Actions for Todos
*Add: Form to add new todos.
*Update: Form to update existing todos.
*Remove: Option to delete todos.

4 Mark Todo as Pending or Completed
Toggle status between 'pending' and 'completed'.

Exporting Gist as Markdown
1 Save Exported Gist to Local System.
Implement functionality to export project summary as a Markdown file.

2 Export as a Secret Gist
Use the GitHub API to create a secret gist.

Code Conventions and Style Guide
* Naming Conventions: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
* Indentation: Follow consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces or 4 spaces).
* File Structure: Organize files by feature (e.g., routes/, controllers/, models/).
* Documentation: Comment on complex code and maintain a README
  
  To build a complete application that manages todos with a database backend and displays details on a webpage, need to provide a basic setup using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and a front-end using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates for simplicity. It also include instructions for setting up, running, and testing the application in the README file.

Application Structure
1 Backend: Node.js with Express and MongoDB.
2 Frontend: EJS for templating.
3 Database: MongoDB for storing projects and todos.

1. Setting Up the Project
   Step 1: Initialize the project.
   Step 2: Install Dependencies.
   Step 3: Create the Project Structure.

   2. Backend Code
      app.js
      models/project.js
      models/todo.js
      routes/projectRoutes.js
      routes/todoRoutes.js

   3. Frontend Code
      views/index.ejs
      views/project.ejs

    4 README File
      README.md
